### About

Sgk Bot is a Discord bot built to measure online duration of users in a channel.

When an user commands to start watch with `!sgk Ã¶lÃ§`, bot triggers an event to work minutely
and update online users' duration. The bot also values social interactions, so salutes users
when their statuses turn to online for first time ðŸ˜„

There is also a little game that you earns ðŸ’µ for every hour you are online. Then you can
buy taco or ayran to other members with your credits.

You can invite the bot to your server with this [link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=675002156948127794&permissions=10240&scope=bot).
